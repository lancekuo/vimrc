# Lance's Vim Notes

[TOC]

This repo stores my most used bundles and tricks.

## General

Scripts

1. `install.sh` handles `vim`, `tmux`, `terraformrc` and `bash_profile`. It will install `Homebrew`, `vim` and `jq` by default.
2. `set-golang.sh` handles all dependencies of vim plugin and environment setup. Since Go would set `GOPATH` to `$HOME/go` from version 1.8 hence we just put `bin/` into our environment variable setup.
3. `set-php.sh` is deprecated.

Take jq tutorial from [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/).

## Bundle: [Vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial/blob/master/README.md)

As title, for golang.

```bash
let g:go_guru_scope = ["github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial"]

```

## Bundle: Struct Split and Join

```Go
package main

type Foo struct {
    Name    string
    Ports   []int
    Enabled bool
}

func main() {
    foo := Foo{Name: "gopher", Ports: []int{80, 443}, Enabled: true}
}
```

* `gS`: Move your cursor at `foo` in #10, spit it into multiple line.
* `gJ`: Move your cursor at `foo`, join it into oneline.

## Bundle: Snippets

```Go
type foo struct {
    Message    string .
                      ^ put your cursor here
    Ports      []int
    ServerName string
}
```

In `insert` mode, type `json` and hit tab. You'll see that it'll be automatically expanded to valid field tag.

## Bundle: AutoClose

Matching the counterpart when you're typing.

## Bundle: Align

Help folks to align text, equals, declarations, tables, etc.

## Bundle: Commentary

Makes commenting out your code with ease!

## Bundle: Surround

Delete/change/add parentheses/quotes/XML-tags/much more with ease.

Usage:

* `ra` :GolangTestCurrentPackage

## Bundle: vim-hjson

The `zf` operator not only creates a fold but also folds the text. To unfold, it press `zo`, and then `zc` closes the fold again. Mnemonics of this is also quite smart (`:help usr_28`). `z` looks like a folded piece of paper, and then `o` stands for "open", and `c` for "close".

There is also `zM` and `zR` to close / open all the folds in the file, no matter how deep. That's super useful with big files when you need to get an overview of the whole file.

And of course, let's not forget about `za`, which works like a toggle. When the cursor is on an open fold, it will close it and the other way around. I'm using it so often that I have it mapped to Space:

```vim
nnoremap <space> za
```

## Notes

Vim-go has the functionality to go over the reference by using `:GoReferrer` but it just works for go language. There is another option we can use for the other languages, most are ruby and javascript.
